//* FOR LOOP:
//* loop mean to try something again and again....
//* FOR LOOP loop in JavaScript is a fundamental control flow statement used for iterating over a block of code a specific number of times. It allows you to execute a set of statements repeatedly, with each iteration potentially changing a variable's value.

//* why we are using for loop , why we feel the need of for loop to use ?

//* to the cleanest cities of pakistan or not.

var cleanestCities = ["islamabad","abatabad", "peshawar", "murrey", "karak"];
var enterYourCity = prompt("Enter your city name:");

if (enterYourCity = cleanestCities[0]) {
    alert(` is belong to the cleanest cities of pakistan.`);
}else if (enterYourCity = cleanestCities[1]) {
    alert (` is belong to the cleanest cities of pakistan.`);
}else if (enterYourCity = cleanestCities[2]) {
    alert (` is belong to the cleanest cities of pakistan.`);
}else if (enterYourCity = cleanestCities[3]) {
    alert (` is belong to the cleanest cities of pakistan.`);
}else if (enterYourCity = cleanestCities[4]) {
    alert (` is belong to the cleanest cities of pakistan.`);
}else {
    alert(` is not belong to the cleanest cities of pakistan.`);
